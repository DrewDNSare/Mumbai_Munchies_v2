This is my new and improved version of Mumbai Munchies Version 2 now realized as a web application with a front end via streamlit and a "backend" and data permanence via pickle files. 

To start this show you'll need to install all the requirements ; in this case its just streamlit

For ease you can use : 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

This should install the version of Streamlit that I used

In order to get the app up on your local computer, run the following command while in the main folder for the app : 

python -m streamlit run ./mumbai_munchies_main.py 

It's best to run it as a module since Windows may act strange and not run it if you try to run it normally.

---------- 06 Sep 2025 ------------

As of 06 Sep 2025 the Add_snack front end feature is available to see. More front end features will be added shortly. The functions for the app are mostly there,
its just the unintended bugs that need to be worked out before more front-end features can be added.
